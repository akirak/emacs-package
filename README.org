** Usage
=melpa-check= depends on [[https://nixos.org/nix/][Nix]], which isn't installed by this action.
You have to install Nix first.
You can use [[https://github.com/cachix/install-nix-action][cachix/install-nix-action]] for this purpose.

A minimal workflow configuration for a single package would be as follows:

#+begin_src yaml
  name: "your-awesome-package"
  on:
    pull_request:
    push:
      paths-ignore:
      - '**/*.md'
      - '**/*.org'

  jobs:
    CI:
      runs-on: ubuntu-latest
      steps:
      # You have to install Nix somehow.
      - uses: cachix/install-nix-action@v8
      # You also have to check out your own repository.
      - uses: actions/checkout@v2
      # Install and configure melpa-check using this action.
      - uses: akirak/emacs-package
      # Use melpa-check to check your package.
      - run: melpa-check lint
      - run: melpa-check byte-compile
      - run: melpa-check buttercup
#+end_src

You can also use matrices for running tests on multiple versions of Emacs.

=melpa-check= also supports repositories with multiple packages.
